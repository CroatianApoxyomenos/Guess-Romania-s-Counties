# Guess-Romania-s-Counties

This is a script which uses Turtle and Pandas modules to work.

It is an interactive way of learning the counties of Romania. Everytime you guess one right, it will appear on the map at its right place.

If you struggle with finishing the game, you can write "exit" in the box and the game will end. After this, a new CSV file will be generated where you will find all the missing counties from the map.

Enjoy!
